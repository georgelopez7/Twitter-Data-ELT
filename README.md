## Description

In this project, we built an ELT (Extract, Load and Transform) pipeline that utilizes the Twitter API to gather tweets containing the word "ChatGPT". The tweets are then parsed to extract various attributes such as the tweet text, user information, and date of tweet which are collected and loaded into a MongoDB database. 

The collected data will be used to conduct sentiment analysis on the tweets by applying natural language processing techniques to determine the overall sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) towards ChatGPT.

Addtionally, apache airflow was implemeted to schedule the extraction of tweets from the Twitter API.

### Technologies and Softwares

- Python
    - **tweepy** package
    
        Used to interact  with the Twitter API and collect the tweets.
    - **pyMongo** package

        Used to interact with MongoDB with Python.
    - **textBlob** package

        Used to conduct sentiment analysis on the collected tweets containing "ChatGPT".
        
- Airflow

    Used to schedule the extraction of tweets from the Twitter API.


- MongoDB
    
    Used MongoDB to load and store the collected data from the Twitter API.
    

- PowerBI
    
    Used to analyse the sentiment scores of the tweets.
